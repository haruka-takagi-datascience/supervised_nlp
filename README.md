# Agreement/Disagreement LSTM model on dialogue data

In this project we will be replicating a 2019 paper by Mikael Apel, Marianna Blix Grimaldi and Isaiah Hull from Sveriges Riksbank (Central Bank of Sweden), titled, "How Much Information Do Monetary Policy Committees Disclose? Evidence from FOMC's Minutes and Transcripts." This paper is in the field of central bank communication, monetary policy and machine learning. This paper does not have any scripts attached to it, so we will be intepreting the methedology from the paper to recreate their results.

We will investigate a specific part of this paper; the section measuring agreement and disagreement in Federal Open Market Committee meeting transcripts.
